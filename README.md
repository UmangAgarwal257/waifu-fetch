## Installation

1. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. **Copy the binary to a global location (requires sudo):**
   ```bash
   sudo cp target/release/waifu-fetch /usr/local/bin/
   ```
   _(This works for most Linux distributions. Make sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `$PATH`.)_

## Requirements

- **Operating System:** Linux (tested on Fedora KDE Plasma)
- **Desktop Environment:** KDE Plasma (Wayland or X11)
- **Dependencies:**
  - [Cargo & Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (for building)
  - `qdbus` (usually provided by `qt5-qttools`)
  - `kquitapp5` and `kstart5` (provided by KDE Plasma)
  - Internet connection (to fetch images)

**Note:**  
This CLI only works on KDE Plasma desktops with the required tools installed.  
Other desktop environments are not supported.

## How it works

- Downloads a random image from waifu.pics based on your chosen category and mode (SFW/NSFW).
- Saves the image as `waifu-wallpaper.jpg` in your home directory.
- Sets it as your KDE Plasma wallpaper using DBus.
- Restarts the Plasma shell for instant wallpaper refresh.
